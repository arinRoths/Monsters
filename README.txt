Hey! Welcome!

In order to run my extra credit maze, if you want to try the maze with just the monster and no sword you will compile:
"maze.c" "file.c" and "main.c"
Then to run a game with a monster you will do:
./main monster.test

If you want to play a game with a monster and sword(extra credit#2), then you will again compile:
"maze.c" "file.c" and "main.c"
Then to run a game with swords and monsters you will do:
./main sword.test

If you want to play a game the third extra credit, a fogged maze you will compile:
"main2.c" "file.c" and "mazeFog.c"
Then to run a game with fog you will do:
./main2 (and then either sword.test, monster.test, or hw.txt; depending on whihc game you want to play with fog)


Goodluck and enjoy the games!
